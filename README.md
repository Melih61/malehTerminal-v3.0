malehTerminal is a custom-built terminal inspired by the functionality and design of Bash. While it doesn't include the full range of Bash commands, it serves as a personal project where I experimented with shell-like features and attempted to replicate core behavior as closely as possible.

## Features
- Custom command-line interface inspired by Bash
- Basic shell commands implemented manually
- Easy to modify and extend
- Lightweight and simple to use

## Usage
Feel free to use, modify, and integrate the code into your own projects. Itâ€™s open-source and available for everyone to explore.

## Status
ðŸ•’ Last updated in 2023
- While relatively old, malehTerminal still functions reasonably well. However, some limitations and bugs may exist due to its age and experimental nature.
- When on startup a text with the message "A update is available" is shown just ignore that
